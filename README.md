# loRA-LLM-Fine-tuning-
This repository contains a step-by-step guide to fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The goal is to train and evaluate domain-specific LLMs with a centralized approach, leveraging the robust ChatGLM2-6B base model and medAlpaca dataset for practical examples.
